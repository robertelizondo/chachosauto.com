    <p>
        I am freshman Engineering student at Texas A&M University. I have always loved to create and experiment with new things, and so this is my first go at creating a website from the ground up. I am from Dallas, Texas. I currently know Python fluently and a bit of Java and MySQL. I am learning HTML5/CSS/JavaScript which is what I used to create this website! I am still learning many of the skills necessary to become a great programmer and hope to one day start my own software company.

        I have worked on a number of software projects and mainly focus on frontend development.
        <span class="ag_scan_button"><a href="https://devpost.com/software/aggie-scan"target="_blank">AggieScan</a></span> is an iOS phone applicaton that allows users to virtualize their student ID cards. Texas A&M students can use this platform as an identification, and allows for easy scanning, using a QR Code system. This application was developed with Swift, Laraval and MySQL during the 24-hour hackathon, TAMUhack. Safr is a cross platform mobile application that tackels the probelem of wreckless driving in Southeast Asia. The application was developed and pitched during the 48-hour event, Aggies Invent. It uses TensorFlow to detect if users are wearing a seatbelt or helmet and rewards them with points that can be redeemed for flight points, gas price reduction or food coupons. This application was develpoed in React Native so that all users may have access to it.
